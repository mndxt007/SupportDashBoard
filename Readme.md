## 🚀 Description

### 🔍 Opportunity

Support Engineers spend an average of **35–50 minutes daily** reviewing their case backlog for prioritization, planning, and follow-ups[^1]. Studies show that **inefficient prioritization** and **manual follow-ups** can extend resolution times by up to **34%**[^2][^3].

### 🤖 Solution

While existing tools like **Case Summary** and **Suggested Actions** offer partial support, engineers still need to manually review each case daily. Our AI-powered system addresses this gap by:

- Providing a **holistic view** of the engineer’s case bin
- **Prioritizing cases** based on urgency, support type, and customer sentiment
- **Automating follow-up emails** and technical action plans
- Delivering a **dashboard** with real-time insights on time and cost savings

### 💥 Impact

By saving at least **one hour per engineer per day**, this solution improves delivery team efficiency by over **11%**[^4], enhances customer satisfaction, reduces resolution times, and cuts operational costs[^5].
